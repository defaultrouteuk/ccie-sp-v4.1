EVE Virtual Lab
---------------
I am using EVE (http://www.eve-ng.net/index.php) for my studies. I did use GNS3 and VIRL before and may use them again. EVE however just seems easier to me for some reason I just found it intuitive. The EVE-NG environment is currently running a direct copy of the VIRL topology from INE SPv4 with the exception of the core IOSv nodes.

Due to a 16 port limitation we have to create two virtual instances and link them (interfaces G3/3-4).
